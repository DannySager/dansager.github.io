<p> My name is Daniel Sager and ever since I was a little kid, I've always been fasinated by computers. I've always wanted to know how computers work and how to program one to follow my instructions. So I traveled up from Long Island to Buffalo, NY, and am currently studing Computer Science at the University at Buffalo. </p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to know from a young age that I wanted to be an engineer. Never once went I would think about what I wanted to do for a living did I not think of being an engineer. I've always enjoyed puzzles and thinking about how to do something better and more efficently. When I combine my passion of computers and engineering together, majoring in Computer Science makes perfect sense. So far, I am enjoying learning how to program and do things I never could.</p>

<p>I'm driven by goals, progress and success. Ever since I was a kid, seeing successful entrepreneurs, especially one's that have made their success through technology, have insired me. People like Elon Musk or Bill Gates have been role models to me not because of their companies, but because of their dedication and devotion to making an impact. I don't want to be an entrepreneur but what I want to be is successful at what I do. I follow in their footsteps of hard work and dedication in order to succeed.</p>
      <p>I don't want to be just a college graduate. I want to be special. I want to stand out from the crowd. I have many goals for my career and so far I've made good progress on the journey but still have a lot left. </p>
